This project is a modern full-stack boilerplate utilizing Next.js 15, Supabase, Shadcn/UI, and more.  
It follows a well-organized structure with Next.js App Router pages in `src/app/`, component definitions under `src/components/`, and utility configurations in `src/lib/`.  

You can review the reusable UI components from `shadcn/ui` in `src/components/ui` and explore the database functionality in `src/lib/supabase`. Additionally, database schema types can be found in `src/types/database.ts`. Component stories are located in `src/stories/` directory and can be viewed using Storybook.  

Each component is structured as a **Single File Component (SFC)**, meaning it contains its logic, styles (if needed), and JSX in a single file.  

For further guidance on authentication, internationalization, and customization, please refer to the project's `README` and the code comments.
